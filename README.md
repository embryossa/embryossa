Serdj Sergeev
Embryology Lab Director | Neural Network Development for IVF Data Analytics


I specialize in developing neural network pipelines to enhance data analytics in IVF laboratories. My work focuses on applying advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep neural networks (DNN), to predict clinical pregnancy outcomes and improve IVF success rates. Through the integration of laboratory and clinical data, I have built a robust QA system that continuously monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) throughout the IVF process. This systematic approach identifies risks and inefficiencies, ensuring optimized workflows and proactive risk management.

The developed pipeline mirrors the IVF treatment journey—analyzing multiple clinical and lab parameters to produce comprehensive pregnancy probability assessments. My model adapts and refines predictions with evolving clinical practices, providing valuable post-treatment insights for further optimization. Our approach ensures that lessons from past cycles improve future protocols, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
